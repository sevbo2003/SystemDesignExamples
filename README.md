# System Design Examples
The sample programs in this repo are mainly based on the content of [SystemsExpert Course](https://www.algoexpert.io/systems/fundamentals).

It is a very good online course that covers the system design fundamentals very well.

Take note that the examples here are only tested on Ubuntu 20.04.

# 23 Map Reduce
This demonstrates a map/reduce example.

## Note
- MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. For more detailed explanation, refer to [this](https://medium.com/system-design-blog/mapreduce-overview-d2082e3a6f07).

- Examples of where an asynchronous MapReduce job could be used:
    - Counting the occurrence of each word in a document
    - Counting URL access frequency in request logs
    - Finding the most commonly-occuring errors in a web application
    - Aggregating North-American YouTube-channel view counts

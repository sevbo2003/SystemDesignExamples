# 07 Availability

## Note
- Availability = The percentage of "uptime" of a system, and sometimes it is described using "nines". For example:
    - 99% = two nines
    - 99.9% = three nines
    - 99.99% = four nines

- Systems with 5 nines and above are considered as high availability.

- Usually service providers need to provide Service-Level Agreement (SLA) which included several Service-Level Objectives (SLO). SLOs typically make guarantees on a system's availability.
